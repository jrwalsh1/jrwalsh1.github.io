# Welcome to my website!

I'm interested in a broad range of computational and mathematical topics from genomics to data science.  Recently, I've transitioned from a career in theoretical particle physics, where I mainly worked on problems related the Large Hadron Collider that included algorithm development, computational and simulation software frameworks, and data analysis.  You can find my publications [here](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/J.R.Walsh.2 "inSPIRE")

I like to work on side projects involving interesting data.  You can find descriptions by following the links above, or by reading through my blog.  I also enjoy learning and tinkering around with math, usually stuff that comes up when I'm working on a project.

I'm still migrating content from my [old website](https://sites.google.com/site/jrwalsh1/ "old site"), if you want to find out about research or data projects I've worked on you can find them there.
